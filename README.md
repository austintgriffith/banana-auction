# 🍌 Banana Auction Machine

> (built with 🏗 scaffold-eth)

Welcome to the Banana Auction Machine - a BuidlGuidl and Juicebox collab

A banana NFT is auctioned off each hour and proceeds go to the BuidlGuidl Juicebox

```sh
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/banana-auction
```
```sh
cd banana-auction
yarn install
yarn fork 
```

Note: The contract relies on JB Protocol and WETH, so it's much easier to fork than redeploy both on a local chain. Thus the `yarn fork` in lieu of `yarn chain` above. If `yarn fork` gives you trouble, try updating the mainnet infura API key in `hardhat.config.js`. Sometimes you have to run it a few times before it works.

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```sh
cd banana-auction
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```sh
cd banana-auction
yarn deploy --reset
```
